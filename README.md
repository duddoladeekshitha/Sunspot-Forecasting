# Sunspot Forecasting with Prophet

**Overview**

This project utilizes the Facebook Prophet library to forecast sunspot activity. The datasets include daily, monthly, and yearly sunspot observations. By preprocessing the data, training models, and generating predictions, this project aims to provide insights into future sunspot activity. The results feature visualizations of historical and forecasted data along with evaluation metrics.
